# Python Programs 
   #### ✦ Upper progrms questions are given below this,

1, Write a Python program to solve the equation z = |x − y| * (x + y) <br> <br>
2, Write a Python program to calculate the surface volume and area of a cylinder. <br><br>
     Formula: <br>
       <p>Volume = pi * radius * radius * height <br>
        Surface area of a cylinder = ((2*pi*radius)*height) + ((pi*radius**2)*2)</p>

 3, Write a Python program to calculate the wind chill index. <br><br>
      The given program calculates the wind chill index using the temperature and wind
   speed entered by the user. The wind chill index is an estimate of how cold the air
   feels to the human body, taking into account the cooling effect of the wind on the
    skin.<br>
prompts the user to enter the wind speed in kilometers per hour and the
temperature in degrees Celsius using the input() function.
<br>The program calculates the wind chill index using the formula: <br>
<p>13.12 + 0.6215*t - 11.37*v**0.16 + 0.3965*t*v**0.16</p> <br>
where t is the temperature in degrees Celsius and v is the wind speed in kilometers
per hour.<br>
Output :<br>
The calculated wind chill index is then rounded to the nearest integer       

#### SELECTIVE STATEMENT PROGRAMS :
<P>4, Accept a number from the user and check whether it's a positive number or not.<br><br>
 5, Accept three sides of the triangle and check whether the triangle is possible or not.<br><br>
 6, Check if the nth power of a number is even or not (get the number and the power as
an input).<br><br>
 7, ACB - Omni Bus Company, has decided to give a traveling fare concession for the
Senior Citizen as 20%, the actual fare will be Rs 1020. The upper age limit for
Senior Citizens is Above ‘60’.<br>
For verification, they will ask for the date of birth (Take Year alone), and if satisfied,
they will be given concession and will be displayed the final traveling charge, if not
original fare will be displayed.<br><br>
8, A rotract club has decided to conduct the Blood donation camp. The eligibility of the
blood donation camp will be the people should be above ‘18’ and his/her weight
should be above 40. The volunteers will enter the name, age and weight of the
person, then it will display whether they are Eligible or not.<br>
Display ‘1’ if they are eligible and ‘0’ if they are not eligible.<br><br>
9, A Company has decided to give BONUS to their Employees based on their Service.<br>
More than 10 YEARS - 10%<br>
More than 6 Years and Less than 10 - 8%<br>
Less than 6 Years - 5%<br>
Ask the user to enter the salary and year of service and print their bonus.<br><br>
10, The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:<br>
 ● Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.<br>
 ● Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.<br>
   ● Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.<br>
 ● All other years are not leap years.<br><br>
 Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating<br>
 whether or not it is a leap year.<br><br>
 Sample Input 1<br>
 1900<br>
 Sample Output 1<br>
 1900 is not a leap year<br>
 Sample Input 2<br>
 2000<br>
 Sample Output 2<br>
 2000 is a leap year <br><br>
11, Restaurant Tip Calculator:<br>
 Steps:<br>
Ratings will be: 1 is bad, 2 is not bad, 3 is average, 4 is good, and 5 is excellent.<br>
Read Food Rating: 1-5 <br>
Read Service Rating: 1-5<br>
Read Ambience Rating: 1–5<br>
Read the bill's amount.<br>
If the food is good or excellent:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Service and ambience are also good or excellent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the tip is 10% of your bill amount.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Service and ambience are average/okay/bad.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the tip is 5% of your amount.<br>
If the food is average, okay, or bad:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Service and ambience are also good or excellent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the tip is 5% of your bill amount.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Service and ambience are average/okay/bad.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then the tip is 1% of your bill amount.<br> <br>
12, Accept the name, age, gender (‘M’ or ‘F’), number of days, and display the wages accordingly.<br>
Age: greater than or equal to 18 and greater than 30, gender: "M”, then wages will be Rs 700 per day.<br>
Age: greater than or equal to 18 and less than 30, gender: "F" then wages will be Rs 750 per day.<br>
If age is greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 40, and gender is "M’, then wages will be Rs 800 per day.<br>
Age: greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 40; gender: "F," then wages will be Rs 800 per day.<br><br>
13, String slice concept example program in python.
