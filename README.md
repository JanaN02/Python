# Python Programs 
   #### ✦ Upper progrms questions are given below this,

1, Write a Python program to solve the equation z = |x − y| * (x + y) <br> <br>
2, Write a Python program to calculate the surface volume and area of a cylinder. <br><br>
     Formula: <br>
       <p>Volume = pi * radius * radius * height <br>
        Surface area of a cylinder = ((2*pi*radius)*height) + ((pi*radius**2)*2)</p>

 3, Write a Python program to calculate the wind chill index. <br><br>
      The given program calculates the wind chill index using the temperature and wind
   speed entered by the user. The wind chill index is an estimate of how cold the air
   feels to the human body, taking into account the cooling effect of the wind on the
    skin.<br>
prompts the user to enter the wind speed in kilometers per hour and the
temperature in degrees Celsius using the input() function.
<br>The program calculates the wind chill index using the formula: <br>
<p>13.12 + 0.6215*t - 11.37*v**0.16 + 0.3965*t*v**0.16</p> <br>
where t is the temperature in degrees Celsius and v is the wind speed in kilometers
per hour.<br>
Output :<br>
The calculated wind chill index is then rounded to the nearest integer
